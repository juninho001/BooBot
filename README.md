Rasa Bot for Bookmark Management (Brazillian Portuguese)

Boobot is an open source bot for bookmark management. Is has been built using Rasa Core and Rasa NLU.
The goal is to create a Chrome, Firefox and Safari extension using the bot to manage the bookmarks.

A feel examples using the bot are:

"Save this page for me"
"Save this page with a deep learning tag"
"List my bookmarks with deep learning, nlp and rnn tags"
"Save www.github.com as git on repositories category"
"Open git"

# english version
I'll train the bot to work on english language as soon as I get it running smoothly in portuguese
